# MyJournal App

This is a journaling application built using NPM, React, GraphQL, and AWS Amplify. The application allows users to create, read, and share journal entries.

## Getting Started

To use the application, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You will be prompted to sign in or create an account. Once you have signed in, you will be taken to the main dashboard where you can create new journal entries, view existing entries, and share entries as needed.

The application uses GraphQL to communicate with the backend and AWS Amplify to manage authentication, authorization, and data storage.
